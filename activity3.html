      <b>Source of Energy:</b>
      <p>
        The source of energy for a geothermal power plant is the heat stored beneath the Earth’s surface, particularly from geothermal reservoirs 
        containing hot water or steam. In regions with hot water wells, this geothermal heat is naturally replenished by the Earth’s internal thermal energy, 
        making it a sustainable and renewable energy source.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
      <b>Conversion Process:</b>
      <p>
        Hot water or steam from deep wells is extracted through production wells and directed to a turbine. The steam pressure spins the turbine blades, 
        converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. This mechanical energy drives an electrical generator, producing electricity. 
        After use, the cooled water is reinjected into the reservoir through injection wells, maintaining pressure and sustainability of the resource.

    <div class="answer-box">
      <b>Output / Utilization:</b>
      <p>
        The main output is clean, renewable electricity, which can power homes, industries, and public utilities. 
        The residual heat can also be used for district heating, greenhouse farming, or drying processes.
      </p>

    <div class="answer-box">
      <b>Real-World Application Relevance:</b>
      <p>
        Geothermal power plants provide reliable baseload electricity with minimal environmental impact. 
        Successful examples include plants in Iceland, New Zealand, and India’s Puga Valley, demonstrating its relevance for regions 
        with geothermal potential and commitment to sustainable energy development.
